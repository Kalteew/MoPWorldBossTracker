## Usage

Toggle the tracker frame via the minimap button or `/mopwb toggle`. The frame shows your level 90+ characters that still need MoP world boss kills for the week. Use `/mopwb show` or `/mopwb hide` to control visibility, `/mopwb minimap` to toggle the minimap button, `/mopwb all` to display every character, and `/mopwb todo` to show only those still needing kills.

Select which bosses are tracked via the addon options panel in the Interface menu.
